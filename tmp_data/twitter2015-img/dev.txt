was	X
found	X
to	X

murdered	X
due	X

[Montessori	X

The	X
Montessori	X
method	X
of	X
education	X
was	X
developed	X
by	X
Italian	X
physician	X
<e:Maria	X
Montessori>Maria	X
Montessori</e>.	X
Emphasizing	X
independence,	X
it	X
views	X
children	X
as	X
naturally	X
eager	X
for	X
knowledge	X
and	X
capable	X
of	X
initiating	X
learning	X
in	X
a	X
sufficiently	X
supportive	X
and	X
well-prepared	X
learning	X
environment.	X
It	X
discourages	X
some	X
conventional	X
measures	X
of	X
achievement,	X
such	X
as	X
grades	X
and	X
tests.	X
Montessori	X
developed	X
her	X
theories	X
in	X
the	X
early	X
1900s	X
through	X
scientific	X
experimentation	X
with	X
her	X
students;	X
the	X
method	X
has	X
since	X
been	X
used	X
in	X
many	X
parts	X
of	X
the	X
world,	X
in	X
public	X
and	X
private	X
schools	X
alike.	X
[newline_symbol]	X
A	X

exist	X
under	X
the	X
name	X
"Montessori",	X
which	X
is	X
not	X
trademarked	X
in	X

Popular	X

and	X
specially	X

teachers.	X
Scientific	X
studies	X
regarding	X
the	X
Montessori	X
method	X
are	X
mostly	X
positive,	X
with	X
a	X
2017	X
review	X
stating	X
that	X
"broad	X
evidence"	X
exists	X
for	X
its	X
efficacy.	X
Some	X
studies	X
suggest	X
that	X
methods	X
closer	X
to	X
Montessori's	X
original	X
approach,	X
rather	X
than	X
modernized	X
methods,	X
are	X
better	X
for	X
