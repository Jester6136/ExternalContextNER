commented	X
that	X

mixes	X
"vulnerability	X

the	X
<e:Refrain>chorus	X

where	X
she	X
repeatedly	X
pleads	X
her	X

"Make	X

about	X
making	X

in	X

"So	X

up	X

an	X
encounter	X
with	X
PKers	X
(Player	X

before	X
joining	X

Twilight	X
Brigade.	X
He	X

obsessed	X
with	X
Ovan's	X
enigmatic	X
nature,	X
which	X
he	X
soon	X
discovers	X

He	X
is	X
an	X
outsider	X
in	X

not	X
very	X
good	X
at	X

He	X
seems	X
to	X
care	X
for	X
Shino	X
in	X
a	X
more	X

After	X

goes	X

Haseo	X
starts	X
to	X
become	X
extremely	X
depressed	X
and	X
also	X
very	X
angry	X
whenever	X
Shino	X
or	X
Tri-Edge	X
are	X
mentioned.	X
He	X
completed	X
a	X
special	X

The	X
Forest	X
of	X

which	X
was	X
said	X
to	X
be	X
impossible	X

His	X
reward	X
was	X
an	X

impossible	X
strength	X

to	X
PK	X
players	X
in	X
an	X
attempt	X
to	X

After	X
his	X
transformation	X
he	X
becomes	X
even	X
more	X
mentally	X

anti-social.	X

According	X

with	X
his	X

on	X

He	X
asked	X
his	X
sisters	X
for	X
help	X
in	X
finding	X
a	X
suitable	X

and	X
descended	X
to	X
earth	X
on	X
a	X

the	X
guise	X
of	X
a	X
warrior.	X
His	X
search	X
of	X
the	X

at	X
first	X
proved	X
futile,	X
which	X
also	X
saddened	X
his	X

In	X
the	X
course	X
of	X

they	X
spotted	X
Vairaumati,	X
a	X
beautiful	X
young	X
woman	X
bathing	X
in	X
a	X
pool	X

The	X

told	X
Oro	X
of	X
their	X
encounter	X
and	X
he	X
decided	X
to	X
make	X
Vairaumati	X
his	X
wife.	X
Vairaumati	X
found	X
this	X
young,	X
strong	X

attractive.	X
Every	X
morning	X

descend	X

a	X
relatively	X
young	X
village.	X
The	X
village	X
is	X
called	X
't	X
Harde	X
because	X
it	X
was	X
built	X
on	X
a	X
patch	X

solid	X
ground	X
in	X
the	X

has	X
the	X

meaning	X
as	X
"hard"	X

As	X
twilight	X
approaches,	X
lovers	X
still	X
haunt	X
the	X
picnic	X
grounds.	X
Starbuck	X
is	X
there	X
as	X
well,	X
alone	X
and	X
quiet,	X
doing	X
a	X
bit	X
of	X
soul-searching	X
("Evenin'	X

admire	X
the	X
majesty	X
of	X
the	X
night	X
sky	X
("Everything	X

For	X
Lizzie,	X
though,	X
twilight	X
means	X
putting	X
an	X
end	X
to	X
her	X
daydreams,	X
and	X
yet,	X
still	X
in	X
search	X
of	X
something	X
she	X
can't	X
quite	X
define,	X
she	X
finds	X
herself	X
drawn	X
to	X
Starbuck's	X

her	X

her	X

dream	X
again‚Äîthis	X

("Melisande").	X
Instinctively	X
defensive,	X

Lizzie	X
counters	X
that	X
her	X
dreams	X
are	X
just	X
a	X

("Simple	X

but	X
feeling	X
that	X
she'll	X
never	X

what	X
she	X
wants,	X
she	X
breaks	X
down.	X
Starbuck	X
grabs	X
her,	X
encouraging	X
her	X
to	X
see	X
herself	X
through	X
her	X
own	X
eyes,	X
and	X
not	X

her;	X
he	X

that	X
the	X

It	X

said	X
that	X
fans	X
of	X
1.	X

Berlin	X
often	X
chanted	X
"The	X

with	X
a	X
reference	X
to	X
the	X

However,	X
some	X
sources	X
suggest	X
that	X
this	X
is	X
partly	X
a	X
myth	X
and	X
exaggerated.	X
Supporters	X

saw	X
themselves	X

this	X

be	X
confused	X
with	X
actual	X

For	X

Honorary	X

"Union	X

if	X
it	X

an	X

In	X
the	X
morning	X
IOC	X
members	X
voted	X
to	X
remove	X
baseball	X
and	X
softball	X
from	X
the	X
games.	X
The	X
decision	X
has	X
triggered	X
dismay	X
in	X
some	X
nations	X
such	X
as	X
the	X
United	X
States	X
where	X
both	X
sports	X
originated	X
from,	X
and	X
Canada,	X
where	X
both	X
have	X
a	X
strong	X
following.	X
Some	X
attributed	X
the	X
exclusion	X
of	X
baseball	X
to	X
the	X
fact	X
that	X
<e:Major	X
League	X
Baseball>Major	X
League	X
Baseball</e>	X
did	X
not	X
allow	X
its	X
players	X
to	X

in	X
the	X
Olympics,	X

the	X

(unlike	X

and	X
the	X
widespread	X
use	X
of	X
prohibited	X
drugs	X
in	X
the	X
professional	X
leagues.	X
The	X
main	X
reason	X
for	X
exclusion	X
of	X
softball	X
was	X
that	X
it	X
was	X
included	X
as	X
a	X
women-only	X
sport	X
mainly	X
to	X
be	X
a	X
gender-equalizer	X

baseball	X
(men-only	X
sport),	X
and	X
with	X
baseball	X
out	X
this	X
reasoning	X
no	X
longer	X
existed.	X
Another	X
reason	X
given	X
was	X
that	X
both	X
sports	X
consist	X
of	X
large	X
teams	X
and	X
their	X
elimination	X
will	X
make	X
room	X
for	X
many	X

which	X

in	X
the	X

of	X
Officer	X

introduced	X
in	X
the	X

Because	X
his	X

French,	X
the	X
actor,	X

perfectly	X

the	X

mangled	X
his	X
words	X
when	X
speaking	X
in	X
the	X
French	X
style.	X
Bostrom	X
therefore	X
altered	X
certain	X
words	X
in	X
his	X
sentences,	X
substituting	X
different	X
vowels	X
and/or	X
consonants,	X

them	X
into	X
different	X

nonsensical	X
words,	X
usually	X

is	X
the	X
line	X
"I	X

and	X
I	X
thought	X

this	X

She	X
also	X
explained	X
the	X
album's	X
title,	X
stating,	X
"I	X

a	X
solo	X
piano	X
demo	X
of	X
the	X
song	X
on	X
November	X
4,	X
1969.	X
According	X
to	X
some	X
sources,	X
when	X
he	X
presented	X
the	X
song	X
to	X
the	X
band,	X
one	X
member	X
initially	X
voiced	X
criticisms.	X
<e:Bruce	X

Johnston</e>	X
remembered	X
Brian	X
"playing	X
it	X
for	X
the	X
band	X
and	X
one	X
member	X
of	X
the	X
band	X
didn't	X
understand	X
it	X
and	X
put	X
it	X
down,	X
and	X
Brian	X
just	X
decided	X
not	X
to	X
show	X
it	X
to	X
us	X
for	X
a	X
few	X

He	X
just	X
put	X
it	X
away.	X
I	X
mean,	X
he	X
was	X
absolutely	X
crushed.	X
This	X
other	X
person	X
just	X
didn't	X
like	X
it."	X
Various	X
sources	X
state	X
that	X
<e:Mike	X
Love>Mike	X
Love</e>	X
had	X
called	X
the	X
song	X
a	X
"downer".	X
Engineer	X
<e:Stephen	X
Desper>Stephen	X
Desper</e>	X
wrote	X
that	X
"the	X
guys	X
often	X
thought	X
the	X
original	X
lyrics	X
to	X
['Til	X
I	X
Die]	X
were	X
drug	X
derived."	X
At	X
one	X
stage,	X
to	X
address	X
the	X
criticism,	X
Wilson	X
changed	X
the	X
lyrics	X
from	X
"It	X
kills	X
my	X
soul"	X
to	X
"It	X
holds	X
me	X
up"	X
or	X
"It	X
fills	X
my	X
soul"	X
and	X
"I	X
lost	X
my	X
way"	X
to	X
"I	X
found	X
my	X

Ultimately,	X
the	X
rest	X
of	X
the	X
group	X
insisted	X
that	X
the	X
original	X

a	X
solo	X

demo	X
of	X
the	X
song	X
on	X
November	X
4,	X
1969.	X
According	X
to	X
some	X
sources,	X
when	X
he	X
presented	X
the	X
song	X
to	X
the	X
band,	X
one	X
member	X
initially	X
voiced	X
criticisms.	X
<e:Bruce	X
Johnston>Bruce	X
Johnston</e>	X
remembered	X
Brian	X
"playing	X
it	X
for	X
the	X

and	X
one	X

the	X

didn't	X
understand	X

put	X
it	X
down,	X

Brian	X
just	X

it	X

for	X
a	X

He	X
just	X

he	X
was	X

like	X
it."	X
Various	X
sources	X
state	X
that	X
<e:Mike	X

had	X
called	X
the	X
song	X
a	X
"downer".	X
Engineer	X
<e:Stephen	X
Desper>Stephen	X
Desper</e>	X
wrote	X
that	X
"the	X

often	X
thought	X
the	X
original	X
lyrics	X
to	X
['Til	X

were	X
drug	X
derived."	X
At	X
one	X
stage,	X
to	X
address	X
the	X
criticism,	X
Wilson	X
changed	X
the	X
lyrics	X
from	X
"It	X
kills	X
my	X
soul"	X
to	X
"It	X
holds	X
me	X
up"	X
or	X
"It	X
fills	X
my	X
soul"	X
and	X
"I	X
lost	X
my	X

to	X
"I	X
found	X
my	X

Ultimately,	X
the	X
rest	X
of	X
the	X

insisted	X
that	X
the	X
