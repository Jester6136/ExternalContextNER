There	X
were	X

his	X

Martin	X
commented:	X
"The	X

went	X
back	X
to	X
these	X

remastered	X
them.	X

them	X

they	X

Martin	X
said:	X
"My	X

was	X
to	X
be	X

the	X

Starbuck	X
is	X
there	X
as	X

alone	X

a	X

not	X

According	X
to	X
biographer	X
Thomas	X
Jerome	X
Seabrook,	X
the	X
recording	X
process	X
for	X
"Heroes"	X
began	X
at	X
a	X

one	X
being	X
completed	X
in	X
just	X
two	X
days.	X
Working	X
the	X

way	X
he	X
did	X
on	X

Visconti	X
fed	X

drums	X

giving	X

what	X
Seabrook	X
calls	X

"distinctive,	X

Davis	X
also	X
added	X
<e:Conga>conga</e>s	X

<e:Timpani>timpani</e>	X
to	X
his	X
set	X
to	X
take	X
advantage	X
of	X
the	X
large	X
studio	X
space.	X
Visconti	X
gave	X
high	X
praise	X
to	X
Davis,	X
calling	X
him	X
"one	X
of	X
the	X
best	X
drummers	X
I've	X
ever	X
worked	X
with,"	X
further	X
calling	X
Alomar	X

Murray	X
"amazing	X

just	X
throw	X
a	X
few	X
chord	X
changes	X
at	X
them	X
and	X
they'd	X
run	X

it."	X
In	X
an	X

with	X
<e:NME>NME</e>	X
later	X
in	X
the	X

Eno	X

was	X
"all	X

Bowie	X
gave	X
"very	X

then	X
the	X

would	X
play.	X
Hesitant	X
at	X

Eno	X
found	X
the	X
process	X
surprisingly	X
effective,	X
with	X
most	X
tracks	X

done	X
in	X
one	X

Eno	X
stated,	X
"We	X

Visconti	X

a	X

demo	X
of	X
the	X

on	X
November	X
4,	X
1969.	X
According	X
to	X
some	X
sources,	X
when	X
he	X
presented	X
the	X
song	X
to	X
the	X
band,	X
one	X
member	X
initially	X
voiced	X
criticisms.	X
<e:Bruce	X
Johnston>Bruce	X

remembered	X
Brian	X
"playing	X
it	X
for	X
the	X

one	X

the	X

didn't	X
understand	X

put	X
it	X

Brian	X
just	X
decided	X
not	X
to	X

it	X

a	X

just	X

he	X
was	X

This	X

like	X
it."	X
Various	X
sources	X
state	X
that	X
<e:Mike	X

had	X
called	X
the	X

a	X
"downer".	X

<e:Stephen	X

wrote	X
that	X
"the	X

often	X
thought	X
the	X
original	X
lyrics	X
to	X
['Til	X

Die]	X
were	X
drug	X
derived."	X
At	X
one	X
stage,	X
to	X
address	X
the	X
criticism,	X
Wilson	X
changed	X
the	X
lyrics	X
from	X
"It	X
kills	X
my	X
soul"	X
to	X
"It	X
holds	X
me	X
up"	X
or	X
"It	X
fills	X
my	X

and	X
"I	X
lost	X
my	X

to	X
"I	X
found	X
my	X

Ultimately,	X
the	X
rest	X
of	X
the	X
group	X
insisted	X
that	X
the	X

be	X

The	X
press	X
and	X
the	X
industry	X
had	X
feared	X
that	X
the	X
change	X
in	X
style	X
would	X
not	X
be	X
taken	X
well	X
with	X
the	X
public,	X
and	X
therefore	X
the	X
album	X
would	X
be	X
commercially	X
unsuccessful	X
as	X
a	X
result.	X
Despite	X
these	X
concerns,	X
Blur	X
was	X
an	X
unexpected	X
success,	X
particularly	X
in	X
America,	X
where	X
the	X
album	X
was	X
certified	X
Gold.	X
However,	X
the	X
band	X
still	X
wanted	X
to	X
innovate,	X
so	X
they	X
decided	X
to	X
embrace	X
a	X
different	X
sound.	X

therapeutic:	X
"If	X

the	X

about	X

to	X

Hours	X
after	X

notified	X

this,	X
he	X

on	X
with	X
his	X
concert	X

<e:Appleton,	X

which	X
was	X
Yankovic's	X

considered	X
the	X

dates	X
therapeutic:	X
"If	X
I	X
didn't	X
have	X
anything	X

I	X

would	X

a	X

everything	X
was	X
just	X
okay."	X
In	X
a	X
2014	X

he	X
cited	X
the	X
deaths	X
of	X
his	X
parents	X
as	X
the	X
worst	X
thing	X
that	X
had	X

adding,	X
"I	X

have	X
to,	X
you	X

One	X
of	X
the	X
most	X
notable,	X
and	X
wittiest,	X
aspects	X
of	X
the	X
language	X
device	X
was	X
in	X
the	X
speech	X
of	X
Officer	X
Crabtree,	X
introduced	X
in	X
the	X
second	X
series.	X
Because	X
his	X
character	X
was	X
English	X
with	X
a	X
poor	X
grasp	X
of	X
French,	X
the	X
actor,	X
<e:Arthur	X
Bostrom>Arthur	X
Bostrom</e>,	X
spoke	X
perfectly	X
in	X
the	X
English	X
style	X
but	X
mangled	X
his	X
words	X
when	X
speaking	X
in	X
the	X
French	X
style.	X
Bostrom	X
therefore	X
altered	X
certain	X
words	X
in	X
his	X
sentences,	X
substituting	X
different	X
vowels	X
and/or	X
consonants,	X
changing	X
them	X
into	X
different	X
or	X
nonsensical	X
words,	X
usually	X
laden	X
with	X
<e:Innuendo>innuendo</e>.	X
An	X
example	X
is	X
the	X
line	X
"I	X
was	X
passing	X
by	X
the	X
door,	X
and	X
I	X
thought	X
I	X
would	X
drop	X
in.",	X
which	X
Bostrom	X
pronounced	X
"I	X
was	X
pissing	X
by	X
the	X
door,	X
and	X
I	X
thought	X
I	X
would	X
drip	X
in".	X
Another	X
example	X
is	X
Crabtree's	X
greeting	X
of	X
"good	X
morning",	X
pronounced	X
"good	X
moaning".	X

what	X

<EOS>	X
Following	X
the	X
initial	X
sessions	X
in	X
July,	X
recording	X
for	X
"Heroes"	X
became	X
more	X
sporadic,	X
with	X
overdubs,	X
vocals	X
and	X
mixing	X
lasting	X
until	X
August.	X
Like	X
its	X
predecessor,	X
lyrics	X
weren't	X
written	X
or	X
recorded	X
until	X
all	X
but	X
Bowie	X
and	X
Visconti	X
departed.	X
Seabrook	X
characterises	X
this	X
stage	X
of	X
recording	X
as	X
"sporadic	X
bursts	X
of	X
inspiration	X
surrounded	X
by	X
longer	X
stretches	X
of	X
contemplation."	X
When	X
making	X
The	X
Idiot	X
and	X
Lust	X
for	X
Life	X
with	X
Iggy	X
Pop,	X
Bowie	X
became	X
fascinated	X
with	X
Pop's	X
ability	X
to	X
improvise	X
lyrics	X
while	X
standing	X
at	X
the	X
microphone.	X
For	X
"Heroes",	X
he	X
decided	X
to	X
use	X
the	X
same	X
method.	X
Visconti	X
later	X
attested:	X
"He'd	X
never	X
have	X
a	X
clue	X
what	X
he'd	X
sing	X
about	X
until	X
he	X
actually	X
walked	X
in	X
front	X
of	X
the	X
microphone."	X
Bowie	X
usually	X
completed	X
his	X
vocals	X
in	X
only	X
one	X
or	X
two	X
takes;	X
Visconti	X
provided	X

also	X
explained	X
the	X

"We	X

on	X

'You	X
should	X
make	X
it	X
a	X

because	X
he'll	X

I	X
started	X
playing	X
really	X
fast	X

then	X
all	X
of	X
a	X

I	X
was	X
like,	X
'Hold	X
on.	X

have	X
something	X
going	X
here.'	X
I	X
started	X
hearing	X
the	X

the	X

and	X
it	X
just	X
started	X
to	X

it	X

revealed	X
that	X

"didn't	X

Mead	X

those	X

that	X
attach	X

to	X
the	X

Jonathan	X

from	X
<e:The	X

Daily	X

gave	X
the	X
episode	X
a	X
2	X
out	X
of	X
5,	X
with	X
a	X
mixed	X
to	X
negative	X
review.	X
He	X
said,	X
"If	X
you’re	X
an	X
American	X
comedy	X
in	X
2017	X
with	X
ambitions	X
to	X
take	X
on	X
the	X
current	X
administration,	X
you’re	X
automatically	X
at	X
the	X
tail-end	X
of	X
a	X
very,	X
very	X
long	X
and	X
angry	X
queue.	X
You	X
should	X
spend	X
your	X
time	X
sharpening	X
your	X
claws	X
and	X
your	X
teeth	X
for	X
the	X
kill.	X
In	X
this	X
episode,	X
Will	X
&	X
Grace	X
did	X
the	X
exact	X
opposite."	X
He	X
felt	X
that	X
the	X
main	X
plot	X
of	X
the	X
premiere	X
was	X
contrived,	X
and	X
"entirely	X
bereft	X
of	X
depth	X
or	X
character	X
development."	X
However,	X
he	X
noticed	X
the	X
attempts	X
of	X
the	X
episode	X
to	X
appear	X
relevant,	X
despite	X
being	X
"a	X
broad,	X
blowsy	X
old-fashioned	X
show."	X
Finally,	X
he	X
mentioned	X
that	X
he	X
would	X
give	X
another	X
chance	X
to	X
the	X
season,	X
as	X
the	X
premiere	X
does	X
not	X
"immediately	X
doom	X
the	X
entire	X
comeback."	X

the	X
episode	X
a	X
3	X
out	X
of	X
5,	X
with	X
a	X
mixed	X
review,	X
saying,	X
"From	X
stem	X
to	X
stern,	X
this	X
episode	X
is	X
like	X
one	X
long	X
exhale	X
for	X
the	X
pent-up	X
liberals	X
who	X
have	X
been	X
glued	X
to	X
outrage	X
Twitter	X
and	X
mainlining	X
Rachel	X
Maddow	X
since	X
the	X
election."	X
He	X
also	X
acknowledged	X
that	X
the	X
episode	X
"isn’t	X
long	X
enough	X
to	X
contain	X
everything",	X
especially	X
the	X
introduction	X
of	X
Tony,	X
and	X
was	X
saddened	X
that	X
the	X
political	X
message	X
ended	X
up	X
being	X
personal.	X
He	X
concluded	X
his	X
review	X
by	X
saying,	X
"Although	X
it's	X
like	X
going	X
back	X

machine,	X
it’s	X
a	X
past	X

certainly	X
won’t	X

or	X
at	X
least	X
until	X
