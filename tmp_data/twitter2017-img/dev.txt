[Tail	X
chasing]	X
Tail	X
chasing	X
is	X
a	X
behaviour	X
exhibited	X
in	X
dogs	X
that	X
is	X
characterized	X
by	X
spinning	X
in	X
tight	X
circles	X
in	X
either	X
direction,	X
and	X
can	X
be	X
slow	X
and	X
focused	X
on	X
the	X
tail	X
or	X
fast	X
and	X
unfocused.	X
It	X
is	X
a	X
compulsion	X
similar	X
to	X
those	X
seen	X
in	X
humans	X
suffering	X
from	X
<e:Obsessive‚Äìcompulsive	X

and	X
it	X
can	X
be	X
quite	X
disruptive	X
to	X
the	X
lives	X
of	X
the	X
dogs	X
themselves,	X
as	X
well	X
as	X
their	X
owners.	X
Some	X
causes	X
have	X
been	X
suggested,	X
including	X
genetic	X
factors,	X
and	X
environmental	X
factors	X
that	X
vary	X
depending	X
on	X
the	X
individual	X
dog.	X
Furthermore,	X
treatment	X
options	X
include	X
drugs	X
that	X
decrease	X
the	X
frequency	X
of	X
tail	X
chasing	X
by	X

Once	X
the	X
strategic	X

is	X
in	X
place,	X
retail	X
managers	X
turn	X
to	X
the	X
more	X
managerial	X
aspects	X
of	X
planning.	X
A	X
retail	X
mix	X
is	X
devised	X
for	X
the	X
purpose	X
of	X
coordinating	X
day-to-day	X
tactical	X
decisions.	X
The	X
retail	X
marketing	X
mix	X
typically	X
consists	X
of	X
six	X
broad	X
decision	X
layers	X
including	X
product	X
decisions,	X
place	X
decisions,	X
promotion,	X
price,	X
personnel	X
and	X
presentation	X
(also	X
known	X
as	X

The	X
retail	X
mix	X
is	X
loosely	X
based	X
on	X
the	X
<e:Marketing	X

but	X
has	X
been	X
expanded	X
and	X
modified	X
in	X
line	X
with	X
the	X
unique	X
needs	X
of	X
the	X
retail	X
context.	X
A	X
number	X
of	X
scholars	X
have	X
argued	X
for	X
an	X
expanded	X
marketing,	X
mix	X
with	X
the	X
inclusion	X
of	X
two	X
new	X
Ps,	X
namely,	X
Personnel	X
and	X
Presentation	X
since	X
these	X
contribute	X
to	X
the	X
customer's	X
unique	X
retail	X
experience	X
and	X
are	X
the	X
principal	X
basis	X
for	X

Yet	X

argue	X
that	X
the	X
Retail	X

(i.e.	X

should	X
be	X
included.	X
