[Cut	E

thrown	E
faster	E

but	E
with	E
more	E
movement	E
than	E
a	E

Some	E
pitchers	E
use	E
a	E
cutter	E
to	E
prevent	E
hitters	E
from	E
expecting	E
their	E
regular	E

A	E
common	E
technique	E
for	E
throwing	E
a	E

is	E
to	E
use	E
a	E
four-seam	E
fastball	E

with	E
the	E
baseball	E
set	E
slightly	E
off	E

in	E

A	E
batter	E

a	E
cutter	E
pitch	E
often	E
achieves	E
only	E
soft	E
contact	E
and	E
an	E
easy	E
out	E
due	E
to	E
the	E

[Tail	E
chasing]	E
Tail	E
chasing	E
is	E
a	E
behaviour	E
exhibited	E
in	E
dogs	E
that	E
is	E
characterized	E
by	E
spinning	E
in	E
tight	E
circles	E
in	E
either	E
direction,	E
and	E
can	E
be	E
slow	E
and	E
focused	E
on	E
the	E
tail	E
or	E
fast	E
and	E
unfocused.	E
It	E
is	E
a	E
compulsion	E
similar	E
to	E
those	E
seen	E
in	E
humans	E
suffering	E
from	E
<e:Obsessive‚Äìcompulsive	E

and	E
it	E
can	E
be	E
quite	E
disruptive	E
to	E
the	E
lives	E
of	E
the	E
dogs	E
themselves,	E
as	E
well	E
as	E
their	E
owners.	E
Some	E
causes	E
have	E
been	E
suggested,	E
including	E
genetic	E
factors,	E
and	E
environmental	E
factors	E
that	E
vary	E
depending	E
on	E
the	E
individual	E
dog.	E
Furthermore,	E
treatment	E
options	E
include	E
drugs	E
that	E
decrease	E
the	E
frequency	E
of	E
tail	E
chasing	E
by	E
targeting	E
the	E

mechanisms,	E
and	E

Once	E
the	E
strategic	E
plan	E
is	E
in	E
place,	E
retail	E
managers	E
turn	E
to	E
the	E
more	E
managerial	E
aspects	E
of	E
planning.	E
A	E
retail	E
mix	E
is	E
devised	E
for	E
the	E
purpose	E
of	E
coordinating	E
day-to-day	E
tactical	E
decisions.	E
The	E
retail	E
marketing	E
mix	E
typically	E
consists	E
of	E
six	E
broad	E
decision	E
layers	E
including	E
product	E
decisions,	E
place	E
decisions,	E
promotion,	E
price,	E
personnel	E
and	E
presentation	E
(also	E
known	E
as	E
physical	E
evidence).	E
The	E
retail	E
mix	E
is	E
loosely	E
based	E
on	E
the	E
<e:Marketing	E

but	E
has	E
been	E
expanded	E
and	E
modified	E
in	E
line	E
with	E
the	E
unique	E
needs	E
of	E
the	E
retail	E
context.	E
A	E
number	E
of	E
scholars	E
have	E
argued	E
for	E
an	E
expanded	E
marketing,	E
mix	E
with	E
the	E
inclusion	E
of	E
two	E
new	E
Ps,	E
namely,	E
Personnel	E
and	E
Presentation	E
since	E
these	E
contribute	E
to	E
the	E
customer's	E
unique	E
retail	E
experience	E
and	E
are	E
the	E
principal	E
basis	E
for	E

Yet	E

argue	E
that	E
the	E

(i.e.	E

should	E
be	E
included.	E
