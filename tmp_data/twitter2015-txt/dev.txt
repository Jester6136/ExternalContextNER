At	X
the	X
time	X
of	X
the	X
album's	X
release,	X
many	X
interpreted	X
the	X
title	X
and	X
cover	X
art	X
as	X
thinly-veiled	X
hints	X
that	X
Supertramp	X
was	X
breaking	X
up.	X
In	X
a	X
2015	X
interview,	X
Hodgson	X
confirmed	X
that	X
he	X
and	X
Davies	X
decided	X
on	X
the	X
title	X
because	X
"we	X
weren't	X
doing	X
[a	X
record]	X
again".	X
He	X
said	X
that	X
he	X
regrets	X
recording	X
the	X
album,	X
calling	X
it	X
"a	X
last-ditch	X
attempt	X
to	X
try	X
and	X
make	X
things	X
happen"	X
after	X
the	X
life	X
had	X
gone	X
out	X

band.	X
Conversely,	X
<e:John	X
Helliwell>John	X
Helliwell</e>	X
said	X
in	X
1986:	X
"We	X
wanted	X
a	X
phrase	X
that	X
bore	X
some	X
relationship	X
with	X
what	X
we	X
were	X
doing	X
but	X
was	X
enigmatic	X
at	X
the	X

time.	X
We	X
always	X
like	X
to	X
have	X
enigmatic	X
titles	X
like	X
<e:Crime	X

This	X

we	X

was	X
going	X

be	X
real	X

We	X
thought	X
we	X
were	X
going	X
to	X
rehearse	X
it	X
and	X
record	X
it	X
real	X
quick	X
and	X
it	X
ended	X
up	X
taking	X
longer	X
than	X
any	X
other	X
so	X
we	X
had	X
to	X
eat	X
our	X
words	X
again.	X
For	X
the	X

three	X

four	X
LPs	X
we've	X
been	X
saying,	X
'Let's	X

So	X
the	X

sprung	X
out	X
of	X
that	X
as	X
well.	X
I	X
can't	X
remember	X

The	X
film	X
opens	X
with	X
a	X
young	X
woman,	X
Devi	X
(<e:Madhuri	X
Dixit>Madhuri	X

who	X
gets	X
sudden	X
visions	X
(usually	X
accompanied	X
with	X
a	X
mild	X
panic	X

of	X
incidents	X
and	X
accidents	X
that	X
are	X

a	X

of	X
her	X

(<e:Moon	X

try	X
to	X

her	X

through	X

but	X
to	X

Devi	X
is	X
relieved	X
after	X
she	X
talks	X
to	X
her	X
sister	X
and	X
finds	X
that	X
she	X
is	X
alive.	X
However,	X
just	X
some	X
time	X
later,	X
Rama	X
is	X
murdered	X
in	X
the	X
same	X
way	X
as	X

had	X
pictured.	X
The	X
murderer	X
hides	X
Rama's	X
body	X
in	X
a	X
mansion's	X
wall.	X
Rama	X
is	X
reported	X
missing.	X
Devi	X
firmly	X
believes	X
Rama	X
is	X
dead.	X
Five	X
years	X
later,	X
Devi	X
moves	X
to	X
her	X
uncle	X
(<e:Ajit	X
Vachani>Ajit	X
Vachani</e>)'s	X
home,	X
where	X
she	X
eventually	X
meets	X
and	X
is	X
courted	X
by	X
millionaire	X
businessman	X
Ram	X
Kumar	X
(<e:Jackie	X

Sunil,	X
who	X
was	X
secretly	X
in	X
love	X
with	X
Devi,	X
is	X
deeply	X
disappointed.	X
Devi	X
and	X
Ram	X
marry	X
and	X
enter	X
his	X
family	X
mansion,	X
which	X
he	X
has	X

after	X

this	X

One	X
of	X
the	X

and	X

aspects	X
of	X
the	X

device	X
was	X
in	X
the	X
speech	X
of	X
Officer	X
Crabtree,	X
introduced	X
in	X
the	X
second	X
series.	X
Because	X
his	X
character	X
was	X
English	X
with	X
a	X
poor	X
grasp	X
of	X
French,	X
the	X
actor,	X
<e:Arthur	X
Bostrom>Arthur	X
Bostrom</e>,	X
spoke	X
perfectly	X
in	X
the	X
English	X
style	X
but	X
mangled	X
his	X
words	X
when	X
speaking	X
in	X
the	X
French	X
style.	X
Bostrom	X
therefore	X
altered	X
certain	X
words	X
in	X
his	X
sentences,	X
substituting	X
different	X
vowels	X
and/or	X
consonants,	X
changing	X
them	X
into	X
different	X
or	X
nonsensical	X
words,	X
usually	X
laden	X
with	X
<e:Innuendo>innuendo</e>.	X
An	X
example	X
is	X
the	X
line	X
"I	X
was	X
passing	X
by	X
the	X
door,	X
and	X
I	X
thought	X
I	X
would	X
drop	X
in.",	X
which	X
Bostrom	X
pronounced	X
"I	X
was	X
pissing	X
by	X
the	X
door,	X
and	X
I	X
thought	X
I	X
would	X
drip	X
in".	X
Another	X
example	X
is	X
Crabtree's	X
greeting	X
of	X
"good	X
morning",	X
pronounced	X
"good	X
moaning".	X

At	X

interpreted	X
the	X

cover	X

as	X
thinly-veiled	X
hints	X
that	X
Supertramp	X
was	X
breaking	X
up.	X
In	X
a	X

interview,	X
Hodgson	X
confirmed	X
that	X
he	X
and	X
Davies	X
decided	X
on	X
the	X
title	X
because	X
"we	X
weren't	X
doing	X
[a	X

He	X
said	X
that	X
he	X
regrets	X

the	X

calling	X
it	X
"a	X

attempt	X
to	X

and	X
make	X
things	X
happen"	X
after	X
the	X
life	X
had	X
gone	X
out	X
of	X
the	X
band.	X
Conversely,	X
<e:John	X
Helliwell>John	X
Helliwell</e>	X
said	X
in	X
1986:	X
"We	X
wanted	X
a	X
phrase	X
that	X
bore	X
some	X
relationship	X
with	X
what	X
we	X
were	X
doing	X
but	X
was	X
enigmatic	X
at	X
the	X

time.	X
We	X
always	X

This	X

we	X

rehearse	X
it	X

it	X

it	X

"Hello,	X

In	X
some	X

<e:Scripting	X

the	X

in	X

(particularly	X

In	X

the	X
equivalent	X

requires	X
the	X
import	X

E.	X
Like	X
Numakawa,	X
he	X
is	X
from	X
Miyazaki	X
Prefecture,	X
but	X
unlike	X
Numakawa,	X
he	X
often	X
speaks	X
in	X
a	X
Miyazaki	X
dialect.	X
His	X
hobby	X
is	X
gambling,	X
especially	X
horse	X
racing,	X
which	X
he	X
is	X
passionate	X
about.	X
Normally,	X
he	X
and	X
Numakawa	X
do	X
not	X
get	X
along	X
very	X
well,	X
but	X
they	X
played	X
well	X
together	X
because	X
of	X
Yamamoto's	X
presence.	X
However,	X
they	X
drifted	X
apart	X
when	X
Yamamoto	X
changed	X
schools	X
and	X
they	X
all	X
graduated	X
from	X
high	X
school.	X
Initially,	X
he	X
and	X
Numakawa	X
were	X
uncomfortable	X
because	X
they	X
had	X
not	X
seen	X
each	X
other	X
for	X
a	X
long	X
time,	X
but	X
because	X
he	X
was	X
passionate	X
about	X
horse	X
racing,	X
he	X
was	X
able	X
have	X
a	X
friendly	X
talk	X
about	X
it	X
with	X
Numakawa	X
and	X
become	X
friends	X
with	X
him	X
even	X
without	X
Yamamoto.	X
He	X
goes	X
outside	X
for	X
the	X
first	X
time	X
in	X
chapter	X
66.	X
It	X
is	X
his	X
first	X
time	X
in	X

he	X
is	X
so	X
excited	X
that	X
he	X
speaks	X
loudly	X
in	X
the	X
train	X
in	X
a	X
dialect,	X
but	X
Numakawa	X
warns	X
him	X
about	X
it.	X
However,	X
he	X
encouraged	X
Numakawa,	X
who	X
was	X

the	X
two	X

That	X
night,	X
Parkins	X
dreams	X
of	X
a	X
man	X
desperately	X
fleeing	X
from	X
a	X
"bobbing,	X
black	X
object"	X
along	X
a	X

the	X
pursuing	X
<e:Ghost>apparition</e>	X
moves	X
in	X
a	X
strange	X
manner	X
and	X
with	X
incredible	X
speed.	X
The	X

repeatedly	X
clambers	X
over	X

in	X
desperation	X
before	X
collapsing	X

the	X

reveals	X
itself	X

the	X
vision	X
immediately	X

Parkins	X

when	X

both	X

the	X

Amos	X
has	X
explained	X
that	X
the	X
idea	X
for	X
the	X
song	X
came	X
to	X
her	X
in	X
a	X
dream.	X
An	X
old	X
African	X
woman	X
was	X
humming	X
the	X
melody	X
to	X
her,	X
and	X
she	X
got	X
up	X
around	X
5:30	X
in	X
the	X
morning	X
to	X
record	X
it.	X
Writing	X
the	X
song,	X
she	X
describes	X
the	X
transition	X
from	X
the	X
melody	X
line	X
around	X
the	X
words	X
"I	X
can't	X
believe	X
that	X
I	X
would	X
keep,	X
keep	X
you	X
from	X
flying"	X
to	X
"and	X
I	X
would	X
cry	X
1000	X
more"	X
as	X
particularly	X
difficult,	X
and	X
what	X
took	X
the	X
longest	X
time.	X
The	X
inspiration	X
for	X
the	X
lyrics	X
came	X
when	X
her	X
father-in-law	X
died,	X
and	X
she	X
claims	X
the	X
song	X
helped	X
her	X

deal	X
with	X
the	X

At	X

time	X

the	X

many	X
interpreted	X
the	X
title	X
and	X
cover	X
art	X
as	X
thinly-veiled	X
hints	X
that	X
Supertramp	X
was	X
breaking	X
up.	X
In	X
a	X
2015	X
interview,	X
Hodgson	X
confirmed	X
that	X
he	X
and	X
Davies	X
decided	X
on	X
the	X
title	X
because	X
"we	X
weren't	X
doing	X
[a	X
record]	X
again".	X
He	X
said	X
that	X
he	X
regrets	X
recording	X
the	X
album,	X
calling	X
it	X
"a	X
last-ditch	X
attempt	X
to	X
try	X
and	X
make	X
things	X
happen"	X
after	X
the	X
life	X
had	X
gone	X
out	X

the	X

Conversely,	X
<e:John	X
Helliwell>John	X
Helliwell</e>	X
said	X
in	X
1986:	X
"We	X
wanted	X
a	X
phrase	X
that	X
bore	X
some	X
relationship	X
with	X
what	X
we	X
were	X
doing	X

was	X
enigmatic	X
at	X

We	X

We	X

we	X
were	X

rehearse	X
it	X

it	X

it	X

up	X

longer	X
than	X
any	X

so	X
we	X
had	X
to	X
eat	X

again.	X
For	X

we've	X
been	X
saying,	X

the	X

out	X

that	X

well.	X

in	X
1991.	X
Shan	X
was	X

invited	X
Snow	X
to	X
begin	X
recording	X
in	X

in	X

Shan	X
introduced	X

to	X

Steve	X

David	X

who	X
immediately	X
signed	X

recorded	X

The	X
inspiration	X
for	X
the	X
song	X
<e:Informer	X

stemmed	X
from	X
a	X
late	X
night	X
incident	X
across	X
the	X

from	X
Snow's	X
Allenbury	X
home.	X
Thus,	X
the	X
song	X
described	X
how	X
a	X
detective	X
incorrectly	X
accused	X
Snow	X
of	X
"stabbing	X
someone	X
down	X
the	X
lane."	X

It	X
is	X
said	X
that	X
fans	X
of	X
1.	X
FC	X
Union	X
Berlin	X
often	X
chanted	X
"The	X
wall	X
must	X
go!",	X
with	X
a	X
reference	X
to	X
the	X
<e:Berlin	X

when	X
the	X
opponents	X
formed	X
a	X
wall	X
during	X
<e:Free	X

in	X
1980s.	X
However,	X
some	X
sources	X
suggest	X
that	X
this	X
is	X
partly	X
a	X
myth	X
and	X
exaggerated.	X
Supporters	X
of	X
Union	X
saw	X
themselves	X
as	X
stubborn	X
and	X
non-conformist.	X
But	X
this	X
image	X
should	X
not	X
be	X
confused	X
with	X
actual	X
resistance.	X
For	X
some	X
supporters	X
of	X
Union,	X
the	X
dissident	X
reputation	X
is	X
a	X
legend	X
that	X
was	X
created	X
after	X
<e:Peaceful	X
Revolution>Die	X
Wende</e>.	X
Honorary	X
president	X
of	X
Union	X
Günter	X
Mielis	X
has	X
said:	X
"Union	X
was	X
not	X
a	X
club	X
of	X
resistance	X
fighters,	X
but	X
we	X
had	X
to	X
fight	X
against	X
a	X

of	X
political	X
and	X
economic	X
resistance	X
over	X

over	X
again.	X
We	X
got	X
strength	X
from	X

Politics	X
was	X
not	X
in	X
the	X
foreground.	X
Most	X
supporters	X
of	X
Union	X
were	X
just	X
normal	X
football	X
supporters.	X
There	X
were	X
no	X
political	X
groups	X
at	X
Union.	X
A	X
supporter	X
of	X
Union	X
from	X
the	X
East	X
German	X
era	X
has	X
said:	X
"With	X
the	X
best	X
of	X
intentions,	X
Union	X
fans	X
did	X
not	X
contribute	X
to	X
the	X
overthrow	X
of	X
the	X
GDR.	X
No	X
way,	X
we	X
were	X
interested	X
in	X
football.	X
There	X
is	X
the	X
cliché	X
about	X
the	X
club	X
for	X
the	X
enemies	X
of	X
the	X

that	X

us".	X

was	X
the	X

the	X

“The	X

another	X

the	X
author's	X
feelings	X

his	X

this	X

mentions	X
that	X
she	X
already	X
knows	X
how	X
he	X
feels	X
about	X
her,	X
and	X
so	X
he's	X
wondering	X
why	X
they	X
are	X
still	X
not	X
together	X
and	X
finds	X
no	X
reasons	X
-	X
she	X
made	X
him	X
feel	X
this	X
way,	X
and	X
now	X
she's	X
the	X
only	X
one	X
that	X
he	X
wants.	X
He	X
believes	X
that	X
this	X
love	X

voted	X
to	X
defer	X
implementation	X

implement	X
the	X

"he	X

this	X
happen	X
for	X

She	X
also	X
explained	X
the	X
album's	X
title,	X
stating,	X
"I	X
decided	X

Prior	X
to	X
the	X
1960s,	X
the	X
drivers	X
were	X
permitted	X
ample	X
time	X
to	X
complete	X
the	X
full	X
500	X

several	X
minutes	X
or	X
over	X
an	X
hour	X
after	X
the	X

crossed	X
the	X

line.	X
In	X
the	X
very	X
early	X
years,	X
completing	X
the	X
full	X
500	X
miles	X
was	X
even	X
a	X
requirement	X

receive	X
any	X
prize	X

For	X

for	X
officials	X
to	X
wait	X
until	X
at	X

10-12	X
cars	X
completed	X
the	X
500	X
miles	X
before	X
waving	X
the	X

However,	X
that	X
was	X

a	X

<EOS>	X
Kakeru's	X
childhood	X
best	X
friend.	X
She	X
met	X
him	X
at	X
the	X
orphanage	X
where	X
they	X
grew	X
up,	X
and	X
was	X
able	X
to	X
help	X
Kakeru	X
feel	X
better	X
after	X
his	X
sister's	X
suicide.	X
She	X
now	X
attends	X
the	X
same	X
high	X
school	X
as	X
Kakeru	X
and	X
spends	X
most	X
of	X
her	X
time	X
with	X
him,	X
causing	X
most	X
other	X
characters	X
to	X
believe	X
that	X
she	X
is	X
Kakeru's	X
girlfriend.	X
In	X
the	X
later	X
part	X
of	X
the	X
story,	X
she	X
discovers	X
that	X
she	X
also	X
has	X
a	X
power	X
that	X
seems	X
to	X
negate	X
others'	X
powers.	X
She	X
and	X
Kukuri	X
name	X
the	X
power	X
"Hand	X
of	X
Glory".	X
However,	X
it's	X
merely	X
a	X
misconception	X
of	X
her	X
and	X
other	X
companions	X
in	X
the	X
"Red	X
Night".	X
Later	X
in	X
the	X
game,	X
she	X
was	X
able	X
to	X
remember	X
why	X
the	X
bloody	X
event	X
at	X
Ayame	X
orphanage,	X
where	X
she,	X
Kakeru,	X
and	X
Kukuri	X
used	X
to	X
live	X
as	X
orphans,	X
happened.	X
It	X
turned	X
out	X
that	X
because	X
her	X
power	X
was	X
awakened	X
and	X
she	X
did	X
not	X
know	X
how	X
to	X
control	X
it	X
at	X
the	X
time,	X
it	X
wreaked	X
havoc	X
in	X
the	X
orphanage.	X
The	X
orphans	X
living	X
there	X
started	X
to	X
go	X
insane	X
and	X
killed	X
each	X
other.	X
She	X
explained	X
Kukuri	X
and	X
Kakeru	X
weren't	X
affected	X
due	X
to	X
her	X
power	X
to	X
nullify.	X
This	X
event	X
had	X
such	X
an	X
impact	X
on	X
her	X
that	X
she	X
sealed	X
this	X
portion	X
of	X
memories	X
in	X
her	X
mind	X
ever	X
since	X
and	X
did	X
not	X
dare	X
to	X
go	X
near	X
the	X
orphanage	X
once	X
she	X
was	X
adopted.	X
Liselotte,	X
while	X
using	X
her	X
connection	X
with	X
the	X
"fragments",	X
tells	X
Yuka	X
that	X
her	X
power	X
is	X
"Phantasmagoria",	X
a	X
special	X
technique/spell	X
used	X
by	X
Liselotte	X
herself.	X
The	X
power	X
allows	X
her	X
to	X
bring	X
out	X
others'	X
worst	X
memories	X
or	X
show	X
people	X
illusions	X
of	X
her	X
own	X
design.	X
She	X
explains	X
that	X
her	X
power	X
appears	X
to	X
nullify	X
others	X
because	X
while	X
being	X
affected	X
by	X
Phantasmagoria,	X
people	X
unconsciously	X
lose	X
the	X
will	X
to	X
maintain	X
their	X
power	X
so	X
it	X
appears	X
as	X
though	X
the	X
power	X
is	X
nullified.	X
While	X
being	X
conscious	X
of	X
her	X
own	X
power,	X
she	X
uses	X
it	X
to	X
try	X
to	X
keep	X
Kakeru	X
to	X
herself	X
by	X
using	X
her	X
power	X
on	X
the	X
whole	X
group	X
and	X
create	X
an	X
illusionary	X
world.	X
She	X
later	X
fades	X
away	X
and	X
is	X
absorbed	X
by	X
Liselotte	X
because	X
she	X
uses	X
up	X
all	X
her	X
power	X
creating	X
the	X
perfect	X
world.	X

Jay-Z	X
responded	X
to	X
Braxton's	X
claims:	X
"I	X
wouldn't	X
want	X
to	X
take	X
it	X
from	X
her.	X
I	X
don't	X
even	X
think	X
like	X
that.	X
My	X
first	X
thought	X
would	X
be,	X
'Maybe	X
I	X
could	X
call	X
her	X
up,	X
maybe	X
I	X
could	X
get	X
on	X
that	X
record.'	X
The	X
most	X
obvious	X
[explanation]	X
is	X
it's	X
neither	X
one	X
of	X
our	X
records.	X
It's	X
not	X
like	X
you	X
made	X
an	X
original	X
idea.	X
She's	X
not	X
in	X
hip-hop,	X
but	X
it	X
happens	X
in	X
hip-hop	X
often.	X
We	X
go	X
to	X
sample	X
the	X
same	X
thing	X
and	X
my	X
record	X
came	X
out	X
first.	X
I'm	X
sorry.	X
What	X
can	X
I	X
do?"	X
He	X
went	X
on	X

that	X
if	X
he	X
had	X
known	X
they	X
were	X
both	X
planning	X

the	X

the	X

the	X

"every	X

She	X

The	X
lyrics,	X
however,	X
caused	X
controversy	X
in	X
the	X

because	X
the	X
line	X
"Hit	X

supposedly	X
has	X
<e:Sadomasochism>sadomasochistic</e>	X

As	X
a	X

the	X
singer	X
said	X
the	X
line	X
"doesn't	X

hit	X

[...]	X
It	X
means	X
just	X

what	X
it	X
really	X
was,	X
was	X
the	X

correctly.	X
What	X
they	X

"hit	X

something.	X
But	X
at	X

it	X

of	X

aspects	X

was	X
in	X
the	X
speech	X
of	X
Officer	X

introduced	X
in	X
the	X
second	X

Because	X
his	X
character	X

with	X
a	X
poor	X
grasp	X
of	X
French,	X
the	X
actor,	X
<e:Arthur	X
Bostrom>Arthur	X
Bostrom</e>,	X
spoke	X
perfectly	X
in	X
the	X
English	X
style	X
but	X
mangled	X
his	X
words	X
when	X
speaking	X
in	X
the	X
French	X
style.	X
Bostrom	X
therefore	X
altered	X
certain	X
words	X
in	X
his	X
sentences,	X
substituting	X
different	X
vowels	X
and/or	X
consonants,	X
changing	X
them	X
into	X
different	X
or	X
nonsensical	X
words,	X
usually	X
laden	X
with	X
<e:Innuendo>innuendo</e>.	X
An	X
example	X
is	X
the	X
line	X
"I	X
was	X
passing	X
by	X
the	X
door,	X
and	X
I	X
thought	X
I	X
would	X
drop	X
in.",	X
which	X
Bostrom	X
pronounced	X
"I	X
was	X
pissing	X
by	X
the	X
door,	X
and	X
I	X
thought	X
I	X
would	X
drip	X
in".	X

One	X
of	X

aspects	X

was	X
in	X
the	X
speech	X
of	X
Officer	X
Crabtree,	X
introduced	X
in	X
the	X
second	X
series.	X
Because	X
his	X
character	X
was	X
English	X
with	X
a	X
poor	X
grasp	X
of	X
French,	X
the	X
actor,	X
<e:Arthur	X
Bostrom>Arthur	X
Bostrom</e>,	X
spoke	X
perfectly	X
in	X
the	X
English	X
style	X
but	X
mangled	X
his	X
words	X
when	X
speaking	X
in	X
the	X
French	X
style.	X
Bostrom	X
therefore	X
altered	X
certain	X
words	X
in	X
his	X
sentences,	X
substituting	X
different	X
vowels	X
and/or	X
consonants,	X
changing	X
them	X
into	X
different	X
or	X
nonsensical	X
words,	X
usually	X
laden	X
with	X
<e:Innuendo>innuendo</e>.	X
An	X
example	X
is	X
the	X
line	X
"I	X
was	X
passing	X
by	X
the	X
door,	X
and	X
I	X
thought	X
I	X
would	X
drop	X
in.",	X
which	X
Bostrom	X
pronounced	X
"I	X
was	X
pissing	X
by	X
the	X
door,	X
and	X
I	X
thought	X
I	X
would	X
drip	X
in".	X
Another	X
example	X
is	X
Crabtree's	X
greeting	X
of	X
"good	X

suddenly	X

Mahalakshmi	X
realizes	X
he	X

Both	X
argue	X
a	X
lot	X
until	X
their	X
parents	X

to	X

Surprisingly,	X
Balu	X

a	X

Mahalakshmi	X
notices	X
that	X

the	X
head	X

a	X
company	X
that	X

more	X

Balu,	X
angry	X
that	X

puts	X
his	X
